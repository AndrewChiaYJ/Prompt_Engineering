    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",

    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

      "He clambered up the rough bark, claws gripping the rough wood. The world below shrunk, the garden a miniature world, the house a mere dollhouse. At the top, he found a hidden world - a sprawling network of branches, a bird's-eye view of the neighbourhood. Below him, the world unfolded like a map, houses like miniature castles, roads like silver ribbons.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent the afternoon exploring, basking in the sun, watching birds build their nests, and, most importantly, being utterly, gloriously free. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows, Bartholomew knew he had to return. He descended the tree, his heart full of the sweet taste of adventure.\n",

       "    * Upstream status (ahead/behind)\n",
       "    * Changes (staged, unstaged, conflicts, etc.)\n",

       "* **Customization Options:** It allows you to configure various aspects of the Git prompt's appearance and behavior, including:\n",
       "    * Colors and themes\n",
       "    * Symbols used for different statuses\n",
       "    * Whether to show the prompt only within a Git repository\n",
       "    * Whether to fetch remote status automatically\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why you would use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Enhanced Git Awareness:**  It provides a visual reminder of your Git repository's state, improving your workflow and making it easier to track changes.\n",
       "* **Increased Productivity:** By quickly showing the branch, changes, and upstream status, you can navigate your project more efficiently.\n",
       "* **Flexibility:** With a wide range of customization options, you can tailor the prompt to suit your preferences and workflow.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Components:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **`git_prompt_config`:**  This function handles loading the color scheme, themes, and defining prompt variables based on user preferences.\n",
       "* **`setGitPrompt`:** The core function that updates your prompt with Git information. It fetches status from Git, formats it based on your settings, and sets the new prompt string.\n",
       "* **`checkUpstream`:** This function fetches remote status periodically to keep the prompt up-to-date.\n",
       "* **`gp_truncate_pwd`:** Helps to truncate the displayed path if it's too long for the terminal.\n",
       "* **`gp_set_window_title`:** Sets the window title with Git-related information.\n",
